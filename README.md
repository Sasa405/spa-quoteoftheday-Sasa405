A Random quote app that shows a random quote when ever the user loads the App(page) or clicks the 'get random quote' button.

1.  A function that returns a random quote from the array of
    quotes that's given in `js/index.js`.There's a nice function for
    random numbers in the MDN documentation for `Math.random()`.

**Note:** _Sometimes it's a good idea to create multiple functions that each
do one specific thing only, to make the code more readable and
easier to maintain / extend._

2.  A 'Random Quote' button as `button` or `input` element beneath the quote element. When the button is clicked, a new quote should be generated.
